# CCP Policies and Economic Potential

The Free World allows the CCP to torment the Chinese to the detriment of them and the rest of us. What if China had continued to grow since the late 19th century? The world would be a lot different today. 

## Overview

Motivation: The World Should care about the Domestic Policies of the Chinese Communist Party
- Review the literature on ways domestic CCP policies are affecting the Chinese.
- China constitutes 1/4 of the world.
- CCP affect us all.

## Literature review - China

### Bei Qin, David Strömberg, and Yanhui Wu (2017) - Why Does China Allow Freer Social Media? Protests versus Surveillance and Propaganda

Qin, et al. document basic facts regarding public debates about contro- versial political issues on Chinese social media. Their documentation is based on a dataset of 13.2 billion blog posts published on Sina Weibo—the most prominent Chinese microblogging platform—during the 2009–2013 period. They also discuss the implications of our findings. Their primary finding is that a shockingly large number of posts on highly sensi- tive topics were published and circulated on social media. Their findings finally suggest that social media in China is likely to increase the power of the central government at the expense of local governments, which will be more closely monitored and have less discretion. Eventually, it may also **lead to increased centralization of power** as the central government’s incentive to decentralize decisions is diminished by its improved ability to acquire local information.

### Bei Qin, David Strömberg, and Yanhui Wu (2018) - Media Bias in China

This paper examines whether and how market competition affected the political bias of government-owned newspapers in China from 1981 to 2011. 
- Measure media bias based on coverage of government mouthpiece content (propaganda) relative to commercial content. 
- A reform that forced newspaper exits (reduced competition) affected media bias by increasing product specialization, with some papers focusing on propaganda and others on commercial content. 
- Lower-level governments produce less-biased content and launch commercial newspapers earlier, eroding higher-level governments’ political goals.  
- Bottom-up competition intensifies the politico-economic trade-off, leading to product proliferation and less audience exposure to propaganda.

### Yuyu Chen and David Y. Yang (2018) - The Impact of Media Censorship: 1984 or Brave New World?

Looks at the effects of access to uncensored media in China using an experiment. The combination of low demand for uncensored information and the moderate social transmission means China’s censorship apparatus may remain robust to a large number of citizens receiving access to an uncensored Internet.
- free access alone does not induce subjects to acquire politically sensitive information
- temporary encouragement leads to a persistent increase in acquisition, indicating that demand is not permanently low
- acquisition brings broad, substantial, and persistent changes to knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and intended behaviors
- social transmission of information is statis- tically significant but small in magnitude. 
 

### Melanie Meng Xue and Mark Koyama (2019) - Autocratic Rule and Social Capital: Evidence from Imperial China

In the end of their paper, they look at the effects of the literary inquisition on attitudes using the General Social Survery and the Chinese Political Survery. They find that people who live in places particularly affected by the inquisiton are less engaged in the community. Autocracies can provide order and public goods when social capital is low. For this reason, autocracy may appeal to individuals in societies with low social capital. Hence, by reduc- ing social capital, autocratic rule can introduce a self-reinforcing cycle that favors its survival and persistence. 

### Mary Gallagher and (2019) - Authoritarian Survival, Resilience, and the Selectorate Theory

The Chinese case fits the portrayal of autocratic survival as a complicated balancing act between measures that make opposing the ruler more costly and measures that reduce the expected gains of a successful overthrow. Since it does not account for this tradeoff, the LPS cannot predict the outcomes we observe in China.

### Dali Yang (2018) - The Making of the Modern State and Quest for Modernity

Final paragraph: In a volume published in 2015, Qin Hui (2015), an eminent historian at Qinghua University in Beijing, reviewed China’s modern history from the perspective of China’s enduring and protracted history of centralized imperial autocracy since the Qin Dynasty. Qin Hui left no doubt in the readers’ mind that he thought contemporary China had yet to go beyond the Qin system of autocratic rule. Qin Hui’s book was promptly banned by the censors. The ban not only underscore the contemporary relevance of Qin Hui’s argument but also reminds us that the remaking of the Chinese state continues to refract the tensions articulated by Weber and Jessop at the start of this chapter. In view of China’s growing strengths and increasing global presence, **how China reconciles these tensions has profound consequences within China and beyond.**

### Juliane Scheffel and Yiwei Zhang (2019) - How does internal migration affect the emotional health of elderly parents left-behind? 

The ageing population resulting from the one-child policy and massive flows of internal migration in China pose major challenges to elderly care in rural areas where elderly support is based on a traditional inter-generational family support mechanism. We use data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study to examine how migration of an adult child affects the emotional health of elderly parents left-behind. As emotional health is a key determinant of the overall health status, our findings have significant impacts on economic development in China.

## Riuxue Jia (2014) - The legacies of forced freedom: China's treaty ports

Jia compares the economic growth between China's treaty ports which date back to the late Qing period. She finds that, focusing on a
sample of prefectures on the coast or on the Yangtze River, I find that population sizes grew much faster in the treaty ports group after it became open to foreign trade and Western institutions. However, when all parts of China were closed to foreign influence between 1949 and 1978, all prefectures in the sample grew at similar rates. After China once more began to open up after the 1980s, these treaty ports were among the first to take advantage of the new globalization opportunities, as shown by the increase in GDP per capita. Treaty ports have better survival rates and attract migrants due to more economic opportunities. Moreover, among different economic activities, the commerce and service sector is the main driver of the long-run advantage of the treaty port group.

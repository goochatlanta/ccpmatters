The Chinese population has gotten richer. Some think that this is group that will bring democracy or at least alter things for China politically for the better. The BRI is marketed as a way to continue the enrichment. Simualtenous with the BRI is a further encroachment on human rights and repression. More wealth and more reason to buck, is this a recipe for an overthrow? Is the heightened repression a sign of internal weaknes? 

There are two perspectives on these Chinese with new money. One that they are a middle class somewhat analagous the Wesern concept. A group that the government has to keep happy. Another perspective is that they are a ruling elite, tied to the survivial of the Party. However defined the BRI wealth inflow may satiate. The typical middle class continues to sustain or even enjoy a better standard of living while the ruling elite middle class directly reaps the benefits of the expansion. 

Either way the BRI is strengthening the Party domestically. Chinese have learned from the collapse of the other Communist states. CCP has been bolstering itself. Pei and Schaeffer discuss how the anti-corruption keep the elites from dividing. 

Trade with the world being essential to China's enrichment. The West crucial role in China’s rise. The US-China trade has... One of my points is how China’s accession into the WTO was a boon to the regime. Enriching China is to support the CCP. 

Shaeffer criticizes Western academics for the blindness to the bad parts of the Chinese government. does the West not take Chinese illiberalism seriously? China as an illiberal regime - Chinese soft power to ease American minds, democracy with Chinese characteristics, democracy with Chinese characteristics. Control of corruption and crony capitalism. Execution and jail without trial. What is corruption exactly.

Social credit and Uyghur suppression. Illiberalism and strengthening.

The new world order did not come about on its own but the inclusion of an illiberal economy in the world economy. The West extended China an accession into the WTO. Previously, the Cold War created a boycott, suffocating the Soviet Union and Cuba. Is this what the TPP suggested doing? 

Westad says that this is not another Cold War. Why are people starting to say that now? Because China is taking initiative to find allies? China has hundreds of bilaternal agreements around the world more than any other country. Why now are warnings of a new Cold War beginning? An alternative AIIB, BRI, etc. 

Over the past decade, China experts have theorized future scenarios for China. In those scenarios, foreign influence is always a threat. Reality suggests an alternative, the assistance of the Party continuation through foreign assistance in mutliple forms. How could the pessimists have their point of view simultaneously to the US money entering China?

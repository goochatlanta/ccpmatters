Economic progress in China has raised the standard of living for all. Has China developed a middle class? Does that middle class have an voice in the political arena that is strengthened by their affluence? Two broad possibilities. First, the middle class could be disparate group of people who are allowing the CCP to stay in power if they continue to get their needs met by the regime. Therefore, simplistically, the CCP is working to please them and economic growth keeps their needs met. An alternative idea is that the middle class is less political way to referring to a ruling elite. If depicted this way, then the outcomes for these elite is tied to the success of the CCP. 

The economic success from the BRI maintains the status quo for the illiberalism of the CCP under both concepts about the middle class. The BRI together with the increasing repression enriches and entrenches the ruling elite and the BRI offsets the repression maintain not increasing the relative deprivation level of the middle class and causing instability.
